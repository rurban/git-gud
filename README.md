# git-gud

A simple git commit checker. I often use a commit message template I created a while ago, and I wanted to make sure that everything was in the right place after writing a commit, that's why this script exists. Use it if you want to *git gud* too. To add this custom git command to git, just place the file in a folder that's in your path (a.k.a `PATH`).

> `git-gud` only works on the last commit of the current branch only, but I'll try to make it work with common options like `git gud -n 10` or `git gud development`. Also a checker for "imperative mood" in the subject seems like a good idea.

### Checks

- [x] Commit author name is in a valid format ( `Antonio Ossa`)
- [x] Commit author name is the same in your config file
- [x] Commit author email is in a valid format (`aaossa@uc.cl`)
- [x] Commit author email is the same in your config file
- [x] Commit subject message uses a maximum of **50 characters**
- [x] Commit body message is not empty
- [x] Commit body message lines use a maximum of **72 characters**
- [x] Commit body message is not empty, ignoring "Signed-off-by: ...", ...
- [x] If "Signed-off-by: " exists, it must be valid (`Signed-off-by: Antonio Ossa <aaossa@uc.cl>`)
- [x] Commit signature is "good" or absent

### Template

This is the template I use. You can find it as [`.gitmessage`](https://github.com/aaossa/git-gud/blob/master/.gitmessage) in this repo and install it following [these instructions](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/better-commit-messages-with-a-gitmessage-template#automation). The script assumes that you're following these conventions, but you can use your own template if you want (or none) and customize the checker too! That's why is OSS :heart::

```
# |<----  Using a Maximum Of 50 Characters  ---->|
# If this commit is applied, it will...
# Examples of imperative mood: Refactor X, Update Y, Remove Z
Subject

# |<----   Try To Limit Each Line to a Maximum Of 72 Characters   ---->|
# What/why/how was this change made?

# Any references to relevant tickets, articles, resources, etc?
# Example: GitHub issue #23

# Something more?
# Reported-by: A person or @somebody
Signed-off-by: Antonio Ossa <aaossa@uc.cl>
